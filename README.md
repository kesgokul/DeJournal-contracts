# DeJournal - A decentralized Journal for Academics

## Mission:

To crerate some sort of a DAO that will function as a decetralized Journal where Academis, Scholars and Scientists can publich their research papers.
It is to run by Academics for Academics in a transparent way.
It aims to make the peer-review process transparent and directly incentiviced for the reviewers.

## Workings

1. Members recieve an ERC-721/soulbound token as a proof of membership which also gives them voting power.
2. The token URI may contain details of their work (accademic achievements, impact, etc ).

## Yet to figure out

### Membership

1. Who qualifies to become a member?
2. How does one become a member?
   - Do existing members need to vote on adding new members?
   - Is it enough for any one existing member to refer and induct another one?
   - Or a certain quorum needed to induct the referred?
   - A one-time membership fee?

### Proposing papers

2. Does one need to be a member to submit (Propose) a Paper for review?
3. What qualifies one to be able to perform reviews (only members)?
